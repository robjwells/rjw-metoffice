<div class="warning">
    <p>
        This crate is currently non-functional. The API it relied upon is no
        longer provided by the Met Office, and a re-write is needed to update
        it to the currently supported API. My hope is that this will be
        completed by Autumn 2025.

Bindings to the UK Met Office's site-specific weather API.
